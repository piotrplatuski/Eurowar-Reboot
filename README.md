# Eurowar Reboot

## Introduction

This project contains the code used to calculate stats, generate events and store the data in Google Sheets.

## Current state

Currently, there are methods for the `Province`, `SeaZone` and `Country` classes. Updating a Google Sheet is already possible, but not yet systematically programmed. The initialisation of classes, with provinces and countries from the American map, is currently being written.
